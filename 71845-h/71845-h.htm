GLYNNE’S WIFE,</span> <img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=" ">
BY JULIA DITTO
YOUNG, AUTHOR OF
“Thistle Down,” “Adrift: a Story of
Niagara,” etc. Mrs. Young is a poet
who has written much but published
little. This, her latest and believed by
her friends to be her best work, is the
product of a mind and heart singularly
gifted by Nature, and ripened by a
long apprenticeship to Art. As a specimen
of the pure “lyric cry,” illustrating
the melody possible in the
English tongue, the volume seems to
stand alone among all the books written
by modern versifiers. Five hundred
and ninety copies are being printed
on smooth Holland hand-made paper,
and twenty-five on Tokio Vellum
paper. Bound in boards and antique
silk; the Vellum copies will have on
various pages special water-color designs
done by the hand of the author.
Every copy will be numbered and
signed by Mrs. Young. Price on Holland
paper, $2.00; Vellum, $5.00.</p>

<p class="dropcap">So then they have gone to their account—the
princes of humor and song. All have their
reward of silence. Some already stand in the deepening
shade of oblivion. The language of earlier
eulogy would have some reference to the sheaves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
they bring to their harvest. The more sharply real
imagery of to-day calls for a change of figure, and
substitutes for sheaves the black bundles of the clothing
district that we see borne by pallid women in
cotton drapery, with needle-pricked fingers, on Saturday
mornings. For the sweat shop has engulfed
them all. They fed the yawning demand for
“copy” till their rest came.</p>

<p>It is a strange sequence of change from the time
of American didactics, when literature thought and
spoke as a child, with the simplicity of childhood
and single aims. Deeper soundings have been made
in every department of letters than the pellucid ripple
of the Osgood-Hemans-Longfellow days afforded.
A dozen of our poets have told more that is in human
hearts than the Sunnyside group ever gauged.
Riley has quickened more smiles and tapped more
tears than Poe with his property Niobes and his
taxidermist shudders put in the verse that ranked
him among our immortals. The humor that bubbled
in Artemus Ward, Showman, was clarified and made
high proof in the satire of Burdette and the Danbury
man. The child songs of Field are truer than
those of Willis and Sigourney and the Cary sisters.
Bret Harte in the stately march of Miss Blanche’s
monologue and the “Saber cuts of Saxon speech”
made more vivid war pictures than all the trumpeters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
of the abolition period. The paragraphers succeeded
the phonetic spellers in the field of humor and bettered
their instruction. The short story writer took
the place of the two volume novelist, and the poetry
of direct appeal superseded the didactic inheritance
wherein classic types were represented by domestic
lay figures scarcely more automatic.</p>

<p>The successive groups—the paragraphers, the short
story builders, the dialect poets, the feulletonists,
the humorists of the Bailey and Nye school, met
the same fate. Prosperity opened its jaws and nearly
all have disappeared therein. The making of monumental
newspapers was the fatal suction in which
each group was lost. Riley celebrating Hoosier
scenery in dialect <i>bouts rimes</i> and Mark Twain
“moving wild laughter in the throat of death” on
the lecture platform, are survivals. The multiplex
Hoe has done the business for each succeeding
phase of American sentiment and humor since the
magazines degenerated into compends of crochet
and pseudo-biography.</p>

<p>In Mr. James L. Ford’s “Literary Shop” the
author reads a severe lesson to the young people
who have ambition to write and be printed.
They should do newspaper work, he says. The desire
for covers and immortality is reprobated. It is
to much more that they should know life, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the life beyond the confines of the barbed wire
fence that shuts out the odorous East side of the
metropolis. But Mr. Ford does not tell his young
people of a literary shop that stifles more genius
than the verse works in Jersey City or the anglomaniac
reminiscence mills on Union Square. He
has forgotten the metropolitan paper that counts its
pages by the ream. What the exclusive clique-ridden
magazine discourages by closed doors the Sunday
maelstrom swallows alive. The glory of bigness is
the destruction of individuality in literary work.
The brand of the sweat shop is on all the yawning
jaws consume—like the slaver cm the boa’s feast.</p>

<p>The successor of the humorist and the domestic
poet is the caustic free lance of the little magazines.
The reaction is a sequence of the unreasoning greed
of the sweat shop. The bibelot is born of the surfeit
of the big newspaper. Readers seek it out—stawed
with too much for their money. And it is a
hopeful sign for individuality in literature that a clean
cut idea is valued for a time more than quantity of
words on paper, even if the latter have the vanishing
magic of a name.</p>

<p>Tonnage has had its day in the literature of America.
The product of the literary sweat shop is taking
its rank with the other things commercially dear to
the money changers and despised of all Philistines.</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A baby was wandering in a strange country.
He was a tattered child with a frowsled
wealth of yellow hair. His dress, of a checked
stuff, was soiled and showed the marks of many conflicts,
like the chain-shirt of a warrior. His suntanned
knees shone above wrinkled stockings which
he pulled up occasionally with an impatient movement
when they entangled his feet. From a gaping
shoe there appeared an array of tiny toes.</p>

<p>He was toddling along an avenue between rows of
stolid, brown houses. He went slowly, with a look
of absorbed interest on his small, flushed face. His
blue eyes stared curiously. Carriages went with a
musical rumble over the smooth asphalt. A man
with a chrysanthemum was going up steps. Two
nursery maids chatted as they walked slowly, while
their charges hobnobbed amiably between perambulators.
A truck wagon roared thunderously in the
distance.</p>

<p>The child from the poor district made his way along
the brown street filled with dull gray shadows.
High up, near the roofs, glancing sun-rays changed
cornices to blazing gold and silvered the fronts of
windows. The wandering baby stopped and stared
at the two children laughing and playing in their carriages
among the heaps of rugs and cushions. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
braced his legs apart in an attitude of earnest attention.
His lower jaw fell and disclosed his small,
even teeth. As they moved on, he followed the carriages
with awe in his face as if contemplating a
pageant. Once one of the babies, with twittering
laughter, shook a gorgeous rattle at him. He smiled
jovially in return.</p>

<p>Finally a nursery maid ceased conversation and,
turning, made a gesture of annoyance.</p>

<p>“Go ’way, little boy,” she said to him. “Go
’way. You’re all dirty.”</p>

<p>He gazed at her with infant tranquility for a moment
and then went slowly off, dragging behind him
a bit of rope he had acquired in another street. He
continued to investigate the new scenes. The people
and houses struck him with interest as would flowers
and trees. Passengers had to avoid the small, absorbed
figure in the middle of the sidewalk. They
glanced at the intent baby face covered with scratches
and dust as with scars and powder smoke.</p>

<p>After a time, the wanderer discovered upon the
pavement, a pretty child in fine clothes playing with
a toy. It was a tiny fire engine painted brilliantly in
crimson and gold. The wheels rattled as its small
owner dragged it uproariously about by means of a
string. The babe with his bit of rope trailing behind
him paused and regarded the child and the toy. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
a long while he remained motionless, save for his
eyes, which followed all movements of the glittering
thing. The owner paid no attention to the spectator
but continued his joyous imitations of phases of the
career of a fire engine. His gleeful baby laugh rang
against the calm fronts of the houses. After a little,
the wandering baby began quietly to sidle nearer.
His bit of rope, now forgotten, dropped at his feet.
He removed his eyes from the toy and glanced expectantly
at the other child.</p>

<p>“Say,” he breathed softly.</p>

<p>The owner of the toy was running down the walk
at top speed. His tongue was clanging like a bell
and his legs were galloping. He did not look around
at the coaxing call from the small, tattered figure on
the curb.</p>

<p>The wandering baby approached still nearer and,
presently, spoke again. “Say,” he murmured,
“le’ me play wif it?”</p>

<p>The other child interrupted some shrill tootings.
He bended his head and spoke disdainfully over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“No,” he said.</p>

<p>The wanderer retreated to the curb. He failed to
notice the bit of rope, once treasured. His eyes followed
as before the winding course of the engine,
and his tender mouth twitched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“Say,” he ventured at last, “is dat yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the other, tilting his round chin. He
drew his property suddenly behind him as if it were
menaced. “Yes,” he repeated, “it’s mine.”</p>

<p>“Well, le’ me play wif it?” said the wandering
baby, with a trembling note of desire in his voice.</p>

<p>“No,” cried the pretty child with determined
lips. “It’s mine! My ma-ma buyed it.”</p>

<p>“Well, tan’t I play wif it?” His voice was a
sob. He stretched forth little, covetous hands.</p>

<p>“No,” the pretty child continued to repeat.
“No, it’s mine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to play wif it,” wailed the other.
A sudden, fierce frown mantled his baby face. He
clenched his fat hands and advanced with a formidable
gesture. He looked some wee battler in a war.</p>

<p>“It’s mine! It’s mine,” cried the pretty child,
his voice in the treble of outraged rights.</p>

<p>“I want it,” roared the wanderer.</p>

<p>“It’s mine! It’s mine!”</p>

<p>“I want it!”</p>

<p>“It’s mine!”</p>

<p>The pretty child retreated to the fence, and there
paused at bay. He protected his property with outstretched
arms. The small vandal made a charge.
There was a short scuffle at the fence. Each grasped
the string to the toy and tugged. Their faces were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
wrinkled with baby rage, the verge of tears. Finally,
the child in tatters gave a supreme tug and
wrenched the string from the other’s hands. He set
off rapidly down the street, bearing the toy in his
arms. He was weeping with the air of a wronged
one who has at last succeeded in achieving his rights.
The other baby was squalling lustily. He seemed
quite helpless. He wrung his chubby hands and railed.</p>

<p>After the small barbarian had got some distance
away, he paused and regarded his booty. His little
form curved with pride. A soft, gleeful smile
loomed through the storm of tears. With great care,
he prepared the toy for traveling. He stopped a
moment on a corner and gazed at the pretty child
whose small figure was quivering with sobs. As the
latter began to show signs of beginning pursuit, the
little vandal turned and vanished down a dark side
street as into a swallowing cavern.</p>

<p class="dropcap">When Championoar and Padmarx tiptoed out of
the elevator the three women were sitting on
a bench in the hall waiting for Clangingharp. Padmarx
sketched a mental cartoon of them, and with
a nod at the bench and a funereal mandamus to silence,
the lawyer led the way into the entry. Clangingharp
let them in. He went on snapping studs
into his shirt, and the callers sat down. Championoar
put his fingers into his vacant waist-coat pocket
and said it must be half-past eleven. Clangingharp
said he couldn’t help that; it was every man’s privilege
to get up when he pleased. Besides, how could
he go to breakfast with Them out there? He drew
on lavender trousers suspended with embroidered
galluses.</p>

<p>“Now see here,” began Championoar, “I don’t
want to make trouble for you, Strings, but this is my
first case, and I’m going to recover or know the reason
why. Friendship’s all right, and I haven’t forgotten
the time you pulled me out of the river by the
neck and nearly broke the neck. But a lawyer has
to win cases.”</p>

<p>“Old man,” said Clangingharp, adjusting his
necktie, “I’m proud to be your first defendant, and
I wish you luck. I think your chances are mighty
bad, but I wish you luck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>Championoar said if every cent was not paid up to
the first of the month before the next morning, Padmarx
would print the story in <i>The Evening Coat</i>,
with pictures of the women.</p>

<p>“You bet your upright piano I will,” said Padmarx,
but Clangingharp said it wasn’t a piano, it
was a folding bed.</p>

<p>Championoar said Clangingharp had no idea what
he had been through trying to keep each of those
women from knowing the others were attempting to
collect alimony.</p>

<p>“Look here, Padmarx,” said Clangingharp,
“buckle up this waist-coat, will you? Well, how in
thunder did they all happen to go to you?”</p>

<p>“They didn’t,” said Championoar. “I went to
them. The Knittenpin woman claims you never
have paid her a dollar”——</p>

<p>“That’s just what I have paid her,” said the defendant,
pulling on a patent leather boot.</p>

<p>“Which makes three hundred. The actress
wants two hundred, and Volumnia”——</p>

<p>“Ah, sweet Volumnia!”</p>

<p>“Volumnia says she hasn’t had a cent from you in
two months—that’s one hundred and fifty. Now
what you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>Clangingharp buttoned up his Prince Albert coat
and pinned a white rose-bud into his button-hole.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
Then he said he would have much money at noon,
and would pay up before five. “Hold on, though.
I never was married to the Knittenpin woman.
She’s got her divorce like the rest—I swear I was
never married to her. I’ll pay the others, but I’m
damned if I pay the Knittenpin woman.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Championoar, “I was best
man.”</p>

<p>“Were you?” said Clangingharp. “I’d forgotten.
Very well, I’ll pay them all. Keep ’em there
as long as you can. I go this way.”</p>

<p>He donned his silken tile and disappeared onto
the fire-escape. They watched him climb by a hall
window into the floor below, and then they heard
the quick, impatient ring of the elevator bell.</p>

<p>Strings Clangingharp hastened to the corner drug
store. Hermia Clinkplunks was pensively sipping
soda water.</p>

<p>“Ah, punctual, my dear,” he whispered. “Did
you get it?”</p>

<p>Looking fondly into his false face she handed him
a small leathern bag and murmured, “Ten thousand.”</p>

<p>Clangingharp thankfully detached a $20 bill from
the stacks in the bag and bought her a package of
chewing gum. Then they went out and were married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>The Knittenpin woman, the Soubrette and Volumnia
at last became hungry and made for the elevator.
The bride was just getting out of it as they approached,
and inquired, “Have you seen anything
of Mr. Clangingharp?”</p>

</div>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> It having come to my notice that nine out of ten
of the people who buy this magazine read from the
back page forward, on account of the phosphorus in
these “notes,” I have decided to make the Side
Talks in future fully one-half of the entire magazine.
The large crop of potatoes, and the prosperous condition
of the School of Philosophy, make it easier for
me to be wiser and more joshuescent than ever before.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> I note a disposition in some quarters to roundly
censure the western college paper that dished over
that old joke of Dean Swift’s, and reported Mr. Hubbard
dead. Why, that story is as true as anything
the present editor of the intercollegiate periodical
has written in the calendar year!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> In summing up a comparison between two prominent
literary men, one of whom is keenly malicious,
and the other graspingly selfish, Clangingharp decided
in favor of the latter in this wise: “I don’t
like either, but if you demand which kind it is best
to encourage, I say as Congressman Horr said of the
farmers of the south, ‘Less hell and more hogs.’”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> A modest knock was heard at Heaven’s Gate.
“Who is it?” called St. Peter.</p>

<p>“A Philistine!” came the assuring answer.</p>

<p>“Goodness! We don’t get anything but Philistines
now-a-days,” remarked the old gentleman.
“Wait a few moments until there is a dozen ready
to come in and I’ll open the gate!”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> In <i>Munsey’s</i> (circulation seven million) for July,
first column on page 512, is this expression, “that terrible
foe of the aborigine—the demon familiarly personified
as John Barleycorn.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Oh, oh, oh! This passion for saying something
else, when you wish to say a thing, is the terrible foe
of the inkling aborigine—familiarly personified as
Munsey’s Monkey.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> About that picture of Miss Jeannette Gilder in the
September <i>Bookman</i>—go on with you, I didn’t say a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Skipkinson Smith, who is quite a Hivite himself,
is said to have said that Clangingharp’s scheme of
making photographic reproductions of all rough
drafts of your poems, so your biographer could trace
the progress of your soul-evolution, was pinched
from Cudahy, and is rot in any event.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> The Rev. Doctor Slicer once went down into a
Cornish mine. After traversing the murky moral
darkness through various winding ways, the safety
lamp carried by the guide suddenly began to splutter;
the flame shot up, flared, flickered and the
wires became red hot, showing the presence of fire-damp.</p>

<p>“Is there no danger?” asked the clergyman of
the miner.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you. You see the flame now is
<i>there</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Well, when it gets to <i>there</i>, you and me will be
in hell in a minute.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Calvinism has gone, but it had several advantages:
for one thing, it gave you peace by supplying a hell
for your rivals and enemies.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> If some latter-day skeptics had been amongst the

honorable mention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Mr. William McIntosh, author of a fine article
printed herein, is the Great Original Philistine. He
is also Managing Editor of the Buffalo <i>News</i>, a paper
that has a larger circulation than any daily between
New York and Chicago. But Mr. McIntosh
will live in history because he wrote the leading article
in the first number of the <span class="smcap">Philistine</span> Magazine,
and not because he is Managing Editor of the Buffalo
<i>News</i>, a paper that has a larger circulation than
any daily between New York and Chicago.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> “Where do you get your plots?” asked the interviewer
of Mr. Zangwill.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, young man, if you’ll say nothing
about it: I get my plots from stories that are sent
me for criticism by little boys and girls.”</p>

<p>“But does not your conscience trouble you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. You see it gives the little boys and
girls a chance to call attention to themselves by crying
aloud that they have been robbed.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> It is now pretty generally conceded that Steve
Crane is in the secret pay of the British Government,
with intent to throw all possible discredit on the
patriotism of the American Volunteer.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> <i>Scribner’s</i> for July shows a picture entitled, “Mr.
Hornaday at work on his Bengal Tiger.” Now my
friend Hornaday, being a genuine Jebusite, is really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
a fine looking man; but Frank Stockton writes me
that in the picture it is a toss-up to know which is
Hornaday and which is the tiger.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> In the <i>Missus’ Home Journal</i> of Philadelphia it is
learned that “Ice cream may be eaten with either a
fork or a spoon.” It is so nice to have an option in
these important matters. Sometimes it is inconvenient
to gum it over the edge of a butter plate in the
New York fashion.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> It is still permissible to wear a white tie in daylight—especially
if the tie is fresh.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Populist whiskers are worn long and bloomers
short.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Finger bowls are made larger this season—with
fluted edges. This avoids mistakes.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> We have proceeded so far in our imitation of foreign
refinements that one who reads the <i>Loidy’s Own</i>
may easily determine where to improve on Providence
in the giving of good gifts. The <i>Loidy’s</i> advises that
“In a hotel one only tips those servants who have
rendered some special service. It is not necessary to
tip servants for doing their usual work.” In private
life the old-fashioned providential way of bestowing
on the just and the unjust, still prevails.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> If you would have friends, be one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> The ’Bus drivers of London are a proud and
’aughty class; yet they recognize a gentleman at
sight, and often unbend—showing a friendliness bordering
on confidence. Among them I have several
dear friends. The true type wears a ’igh ’at, a ’igh
collar and a red scarf, dimun pin, kid gloves and in
the lapel of his coat is a half-blown moss rose, supplied
stealthily by some sweet maid. Then he has
his own private lap robe, used only in fine weather,
with his initials worked in yellow worsted across the
center. I never saw John the slightest frustrated or
impatient. He may be “laid out,” or bumped into,
or bump into others, which he prefers, yet the reins
are still held lightly in one hand and with the whip
in the other, he tosses a kiss to some fair lidy, and
all so deftly done that none but she (and I) understand.
’Bus conductors get only half the pay of
drivers and are a cringing, knavish lot, totally unfit
to associate with gentlemen, and are never recognized
by women who possess any degree of self respect.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> I went to the Tabernacle where Spurgeon, the son
of his father, preaches to six thousand people. The
great man waved his arms, stamped wildly and spoke
with vehemence of the iniquities of the wicked city
of London. “Why does not God sink the place in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
a night, as he did Sodom and Gomorrah!” shrieked
Mr. Spurgeon.</p>

<p>A man from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, seated next me,
wrote on the fly leaf of his hymn book: “Because
Henry Irving, play actor; William Morris, infidel,
and Zangwill, Jew, live here.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> I see that Mr. W. W. Denslow is being spoken of
by the Chicago papers as the Leonardo da Vinci of
the North Side. Den draws things, paints divinely,
is a good collar-and-elbow philosopher, an all ’round
wit, a story teller of no mean repute, and like Mr.
Boffin, occasionally drops into poetry. But they do
say that all of Den’s really choice ideas are supplied
by his wife, daughter of Amber and child of her
gifted mother. Happy Den! he doesn’t have to
think; like a hippocampus, he just absorbs.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> I have received from the publishers a book written
by an Englishman, entitled, <i>The Art of Graceful
Horseback Riding Taught in Ten Chapters</i>. The
work reads like a lecture on rhetoric by the Shock-headed
Youth in English A at Harvard.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Haven’t you ever felt that the prince is as good as
the pauper even if he is no better?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Who says that we are not an artistic people? All
that was necessary was the faith of two American
patriots like Koster and Bial, to pack the galleries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
with spectators of such masterpieces as <i>The Bath</i>
and <i>The Flea Hunt</i> whose living models had
been chosen with great care so as not to offend the
delicate popular sense of beauty.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> “Ephemeral?” Yes!—I’m still, you see, the
butterfly flitting from flower to flower; while the
busy, bumptious bumble-bee improves each shining
hour.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> One James L. Ford claims to have discovered Bok.
But Ford is not like charity; he is exceeding puffed
up and doth vaunt himself unseemly. In homeopathic
doses Ford is funny, but one reaches a point
where he wants to carry this too funny man in a
buck basket to the wharf and dump him for good
and all.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> To Anxious One: No, <i>Every Man His Own
Trainer</i>, by Jack Splan, is not a work on Theosophy.
Its general theme is education after the manner
taught in <i>Successward</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Mr. Chester S. Lord, managing editor of the New
York <i>Sun</i>, recently discharged a reporter for wearing
a pink shirt with a blue collar. Mr. Lord declares
that any man who gets a salary of thirty dollars a
week and yet is in such financial distress that he cannot
match up his linen is not to be trusted.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Plain living and high thinking do not go together

have the money to live high, and not having the
money to live high you live plain—see?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Yes, let sound and perfume and color evolve from
the wild, natural, divine joy of life. Let art be born
that is wayward as the western winds; so long as it
expresses that which the many feel, or arouses to life
the hopes that are dead, or animates with renewed
strength the ambitions that falter, or fans to flame
the loves that languish, so long will we bid it hail
and God-speed!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Let the bicycle teach the great moral truth that
unstable equilibrium is made stable by progressive
motion. He who stands still is lost.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Certain of the truths herein set forth have been
expressed before, but not well.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> A retentive memory is a great thing, but the ability
to forget is the true token of greatness.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Latest advices confirm the report that Mephisto
(who walks with a slight limp, having had a fall)
was put out of Heaven on account of his shocking
bad temper. He was afflicted with dyspepsia. After
all, Heaven is largely a matter of digestion, and
come to think of it digestion is mostly a matter of
mind.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> I know not what others may say, but as for me,
my single self, the Great Big Black Things that
loomed against the horizon, threatening to come and
devour me, simply loomed and nothing more. The
things that really made me miss my train were soft,
sweet, pleasant, pretty things of which I was not in
the least afraid.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> This, which seemed at first to be a non-sequitur,
was found in the Buffalo <i>Courier</i> of recent date:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Bishop Walker is a man of extremely lovable
nature and may be seen during his stay at the Iroquois,
or taking constitutional walks about the blocks
surrounding the hotel.”</p>

</div>

<p>On more mature consideration it seems that the
Cathedral Car prelate was simply candidating.
There are other persons of extremely lovable nature
who meander around the same part of Buffalo betimes,
and devour all they pick up.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> I fear there will not be general public sympathy
with Mr. F. Tennyson Neeley of Chicago in his defense
of the suit of Col. Richard Henry Savage, but
as a matter of justice, it would seem that $12,000 is
a small fine for inflicting such books as <i>My Official
Wife</i> and others on a suffering public. And if Mr.
Neeley, having gotten some of the Colonel’s pile,
keeps it, the latter gentleman should remember it’s
Chicago and thank his stars they didn’t take it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> The Anti-Slang Club of Somerset, N. J., sent $5.50
the other day to the New York <i>Herald’s</i> Ice Fund
and one of the members confidentially writes me,
“They can’t say now that Anti-Slang don’t cut no
ice.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Now that Winter is in the offing and Discontent at
the door, it is pleasant to think that Organized Charity
is getting ready for the season. The plan of
campaign is a simple one, but lest I should provoke
a charge of misconstruction, I take leave to state it
in the words of the author of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, who was
never accused of exaggerating anything:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mrs. Corney,” said the beadle, smiling as men
smile who are conscious of superior information,
“out-of-door relief, properly managed, properly
managed, ma’am, is the parochial safeguard. The
great principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the
paupers exactly what they don’t want, and then they
get tired of coming.”</p>

</div>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> On the authority of Mr. Frank L. Stanton of Atlanta,
Hamlin Garland is quoted as saying, “I will
stick to the soil till I die.” That is a very sub-tropical
way of putting it, and I don’t wonder the Georgian
likes it. To be more accurate, the soil will stick
to Hamlin—and it will do so after he dies too.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Way down South where tradition is king and they
hark back for all the glory of life, it has been surmised
that Li is in some way connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
family of the great soldier of the Confederacy and an
investigation is going on with the hope of establishing
a relation of elbow kin with the Celestial prince.
It ought not to be news to my Southern friends that
the Lees are great people in China. For these many
years the secret faction fights which take the place of
politics in the land of the sun have been between the
Lees and the Chews. The latter are supposed to be
in some way consanguine to the Chaws of Castle Garden.
If so, it will be seen that the Flowery Kingdom
is divided on much the same lines as Tammany
Hall, and Li may have good reasons for feeling
much at home in New York.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> From the <span class="smcap">Philistine</span> view-point it is very funny to
note the panic among our friends of the cloth at the
inroads that bicycles are making on the attendance at
the churches. Some of the reverend gentlemen seem
to overlook the well-established philosophic fact that
religion is innate and fundamental in human nature
and is bound to assert itself somehow. The present
symptom fills them with anxiety, and what most
gets them, so to speak, is that “fair weather Christians,”
so-called, are the ones who are missing now.
When it rains it’s too wet and when it’s fair they go
wheeling. One minister takes his robes and his liturgy
and follows his sheep to the park—but that’s a
stern chase. Another checks wheels and his Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
school room looks like a road house. I suppose a
bowling alley and golf links will be next. There’s
no real reason for alarm, of course. Relief will
come from the opposite side, as it usually comes.
Wheeling is going to diminish the ranks of the old
maids, and marriage is the nursery of the church.
But in all fairness I think there should be no commutation
of wedding fees in favor of wheel marriages.
It costs just as much to splice a pair in bloomers and
goff socks as if they wore point lace and waiter coats
and it has happened that future millionaires and millionairesses
have been married with a foot on the
pedal, so to say. Let no gilty one escape.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> The true Driver of the Quill is a virtuous Person.
He wears his hair long in token that he does not
sleep with his precious head in the lap of Delilah.
To every literary Aspirant my advice is: Leave thy
sconce well thatched and keep comb and scissors at
the distance of an Irish mile. Let thy shock grow
like a young forest, allowing it to be tossed by the
wanton western wind, but touched not by horse clippers
nor sheep shears. The Greeks were called the
long-haired. Scissors were a barbarous Roman invention,
afterwards adopted by the Puritans. In
olden time the first mark set on a slave was to shave
his head, and any man who getteth even now a sentence
of sixty days secures a close crop; whereas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
thirty-day guests go untrimmed. Yea, wear thy hair
longer than a lawsuit. It is the sign that thou art
Free.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> When Philip asked that eunuch “Understandest
thou what thou readest?” he propounded a very
needless question. Only men and women who are
well sexed understand what they read; ’tis they, and
they only, who possess the ability to see the unseen.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> “Do you ever get lonesome?” asked the Giddy
Youth of the Only Bernhardt. “Do I get lonesome?
Why, little boy, I often get as lonesome as my feet
were the first time I rode a horse astride,” was the
answer.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Come, fellows: leave thinking of your thoughts
and feeling of your feelings; never mind how your
heroine would have regarded herself if the lover had
spoken earlier or later—he didn’t, so it doesn’t matter
a rap; and don’t fret too awfully much about the
way your yarn is to get itself into words. Only give
us something behind the words. Give us action,
story, incident, life. More things are happening
right here in Yankeeland than in any other equal
space of earth. Tell about them.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> If Dr. Conan Doyle and Miss Mary Wilkins and
Miss Sarah O. Jewett had sent the same kind of literature
to the magazines, and things, ten years ago<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
that they send now, how cheerfully it would not
have been accepted.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> My Trans-Asian neighbor, Li Hung Chang, tells
me he felt quite at home when he came into this
country and found everybody wearing button decorations.
He was a little shocked though when he
found the insignia of rank devoted to party cries and ribald
slang—for he comes of a sincere race, and veneration
for dignities is a principle of life with them.
However, he thinks we are well on the way to the
establishment of privileged orders. The self made
crests on our carriages further encouraged him. No
doubt he will see more of these as he goes on. If
he attends our theaters he will find privilege pretty
well installed, as the managers can tell him to their
sorrow. It has its drawbacks of course. For example,
the desire for special honors leads some people
who have money to spend to go to great effort to get
newspaper credentials at such places. In one of our
provincial cities you will see millionaires enjoying the
play at the expense of a newspaper. In the Buffalo
suburb of this metropolis of Philistia is a society
leaderess who has been known to extort “passes”
in exchange for society items and then go to the box
office and have them exchanged so she “would not
have to sit in newspaper seats.” This is the sordid
side of privilege. I think it may surprise Li.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> An eminent Pittsburg physician with a scientific
bent has made the revelation that if you are a normal
man you have one hundred and twenty-eight eye-winkers
on one side and one hundred and thirty-two
on the other; and that if you lose six from either
side you have appendicitis. It was Balzac who discovered
that any woman with two tiny black specks
on the end of her nose was fond of amusement.
Great is Science!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> “A widow does not pay formal visits for one year
after her bereavement,” according to Mrs. Isabel
Wallon. This is almost an incitement to murder.
It’s a wonder it wasn’t in the Chicago platform.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> The kind of self-consciousness that calls itself
propriety enters even the sanctuary of devotion.
The <i>Betchersweetlife-I’m-a-Lady’s Home Journal</i>
reminds its devotees that “It is very improper to
recognize an acquaintance during service in church.”
Nothing is left to instinct in the Narcissean <i>Lady’s
Own</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Ruth Ashmore is authority that “Flowers may,

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Ras Wilson says (and I hope you know Ras Wilson,
for if you don’t you have dropped something out of
your life) Ras he says to the new reporter, “Young
man, write as you feel; but try and feel right. Feel
good humored towards every one and every thing.
Believe that other folks are just as good and just as
smart as you, for they are. Give ’em your best and
bear in mind that God has sent ’em in His wisdom
all the trouble they need, and it’s for you to scatter
gladness and decent, helpful things as you go.
Don’t be too particular about how the stuff will look
in type, but let ’er go—some one will understand.
That is better than to write so dosh bing high and so
tarnashun deep that no one understands—let ’er go!”</p>
